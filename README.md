gatling-maven-plugin-demo
=========================

Simple showcase of a maven project using the gatling-maven-plugin.

To test it out, simply execute the following command:

    $mvn gatling:test -Dgatling.simulationClass=computerdatabase.BasicSimulation

or simply:

    $mvn gatling:test

Gatling setup CI and Docker

This is repo running load test with gatling locally as well as inside docker containers. It does following things

Get Gatling Setup into your Jenkins WORKSPACE or local directory

Docker image and contaners with Gatling setup

Generate report in HTML.

Easy to use bash scripts plauggable with Jenkins or any othe CI server

Usage
Pre-requisite is to have JDK(Java) installed as scala being JVM based language.

Run Gatling Test Locally
Download/Checkout this project

     $ git clone https://github.com/Shashikant86/Docker-Gatling.git
Running Gatling Test locally (Works from Mac)

  sh gatling_local.sh
This script will download Gatling with version 2.2.5 and unzip the binary and run tests with our simulation.

At the end you will see link to HTML report. Open it into browser and enjoy !!

(Optional) Record your load test simulations and put your class in the 'user-files/simulations'. OR You can use the pre-recorded simulation for this demo as it is
Running Gatling Test Inside Docker Containers
Pre-defined Simulation
Download the pre-built Docker-Gatling image from DockerHub here

       $ docker pull shashikant86/docker-gatling
Run container using the downloaded images

     $ docker run -it -d --name docker-gatling-container shashikant86/docker-gatling 
Run default simulations inside the docker containers

     $ docker exec docker-gatling-container /opt/gatling/bin/gatling.sh -sf /opt/gatling/user-files/simulations/ -s computerdatabase.BasicSimulation -rf /opt/gatling/results/
This will execute default simulation.

Mount your own Simulation
Download the pre-built Docker-Gatling image from DockerHub here

       $ docker pull shashikant86/docker-gatling
Run container using the downloaded images with mounted simulation

docker run -it -d --rm -v conf:/opt/gatling/conf \ -v user-files:/opt/gatling/user-files \ -v results:/opt/gatling/results \ --name docker-gatling-container shashikant86/docker-gatling

OR

Running Gatling Test locally using the script

  sh docker_local.sh
This will download docker image and start container.

Run Gatling Test on Jenkins
Record your load test simulations and put your class in the 'user-files/simulations'. OR You can use the pre-recorded simulation for this demo

Run gatling-jenkins.sh as part of execute shell script
